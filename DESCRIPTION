Description: Provides the 'Molecular Signatures Database' (MSigDB) gene sets
    typically used with the 'Gene Set Enrichment Analysis' (GSEA) software
    (Subramanian et al. 2005 <doi:10.1073/pnas.0506580102>, Liberzon et al. 2015
    <doi:10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004>) in a standard R data frame with key-value
    pairs. The package includes the human genes as listed in MSigDB as well as
    the corresponding symbols and IDs for frequently studied model organisms
    such as mouse, rat, pig, fly, and yeast.
