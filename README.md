The msigdbr R package provides Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets typically used with the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software:

* in an R-friendly "[tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)" format with one gene pair per row
* for multiple frequently studied model organisms, such as mouse, rat, pig, zebrafish, fly, and yeast, in addition to the original human genes
* as gene symbols as well as NCBI Entrez and Ensembl IDs
* without accessing external resources requiring an active internet connection
